# CSV+Git test

This is a quick project/repository to test and demonstrate
the use of git and github to put CSVs in version control

## Motivation

CSV is one of several test-based data formats, and git as a version control system works best with text formats like CSV, TSV, JSON, etc.  

The idea is to great a git history of changes to varioius data formats to examine how the ecosystem of git versioning tools, especially 'diff' tools, works to identify what was changed in a data file, and who changed it. 

Secondly to test code/data development environments such as VS Code, Rstudio, Python notebooks etc for working with text-based data.
